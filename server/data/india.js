                'description':`Unlike the calm and serene beaches that we have been writing about in this list, Vagator Beach is a little bit crowded with plenty of bars and shacks build to cater to the need to people visiting here. The golden sandy beach of this place is dark in color thanks to the red cliffs that line the seashore and makes it even prettier. Further, the palm trees, secluded coves, and a number of party spots make Vagator one of the most pleasurable beach destinations of Goa. It has some of the best hotels and resorts lying adjacent to the cliff, making it one of the best beaches for luxury holidays in India.`
